[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:36 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findncurses.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "ncurses", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ncurses" with any
  of the following names:

    ncursesConfig.cmake
    ncurses-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ncurses" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ncurses_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ncurses" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
